## About the project

Talking to Czech developers, I have noticed that there is one word, the pronunciation of which causes exceptional

Creating this website fights this problem which permeates the Czech developers' society, and it is an excellent excuse
for me to have a little fun with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Web Audio API.
