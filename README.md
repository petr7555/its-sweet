## About the project

Talking to Czech developers, I have noticed that there is one word, the pronunciation of which causes exceptional
difficulties. It's the word "suite" (e.g. as in NetSuite).

This website points out that the word is pronounced the same way as the word "sweet".
In particular, it is not pronounced as ![Wrong Czech pronunciation of "suite"](./assets/suite_wrong_czech_pronunciation.mov).

Creating this website fights this problem which permeates the Czech developers' society, and it is an excellent excuse
for me to have a little fun with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Web Audio API.
